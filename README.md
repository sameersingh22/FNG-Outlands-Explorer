#FNG Outlands Explorer (Version 1.0.0)
##Overview
FNG Outlands Explorer (referred to as the "companion app", for the purposes of this document) is an unofficial companion app for the video game "Apex Legends" (referred to as "Apex"). The companion app is divided into 3 screens using navigation tabs: Legends, Loadout, and Heirloom Calculator. 
###Legends
This screen lists each of the 20 playable characters, also known as "Legends". Each legend has 3 abilities in the game. The user can click/tap on a Legend's name for a brief description of the abilities of that legend, along with the reason of their participation in the Apex Games.
###Loadout
This screen lists each of the 28 weapons available in the game sorted in 6 categories, namely: Assault Rifles, Sub Machine Guns, Light Machine Guns, Sniper Rifles, Shotguns, and Pistols. Each weapon has its own set of attachments. The current version of the app does not explain each attachment in detail, but this will be changed in the coming updates.
###Heirloom Calculator
To understand the concept of heirlooms, it is important to understand what an Apex pack is, and the different currencies available in Apex. A player cannot have a pack when they are at level 1. Apex rewards its players with Apex packs once they level up. Each pack consists of 3 unlockables- they could be legend/weapon skins or other cosmetics, crafting materials, or heirloom shards. However, a player is not awarded a pack on every level, instead the packs are awarded as follows:

Level 2   -  20: One pack every level
Level 22  - 300: One pack every two levels
Level 305 - 500: One pack every five levels

Every "modern" video game has some currency structure. In Apex, there are 3 different kinds of currencies available: Crafting Materials (used for unlocking cosmetics for Legends and weapons; obtained from Apex packs, and very few event-specific challenges), Legend Tokens (used for unlocking Legends, and purchasing exclusive Legend/Weapon skins; obtained only by levelling up), Apex Coins (the most premium currency, only currency in game that can be bought with real life currency; used to purchase Apex packs, and multiple other cosmetics; obtained by levelling the battle pass up, or available for purchase otherwise). 

Now that an understanding of packs and currencies has been developed, it is easy to explain the concept of heirlooms. Most of the legends (13 Legends, as of season 12) have a cosmetic item unique to that legend. This cosmetic is labelled as "heirloom" and can be unlocked using 150 "heirloom shards". Heirlooms are further divided into melee weapons and prestige skins. 
The heirloom shards can only be found in Apex packs, and nowhere else. If the player opens a pack containing heirloom shards (the player will be unaware of the rewards prior to the pack opening), the player will not receive any other reward from that particular pack; instead, each of the 3 rewards from that pack would have 50 heirloom shards. The reason why heirloom shards are so rare is because 1 heirloom drop is guaranteed every 500 packs, although technically speaking a "lucky" player can get multiple heirlooms on consecutive packs. Because Apex does not award a lot of apex packs for free to players, and opening packs is the only way to get the heirloom shards, heirlooms are considered to be the most rare cosmetic in the game. 

The "Heirloom Calculator" screen of the companion app takes into account the level of the user, number of packs they purchased, and packs achieved from other sources (events, battle pass, bugs, etc.) and evaluates how many packs has the user opened. This way, the user/player can get an idea of how many packs they need to open until they reach the next 500th pack for a guaranteed heirloom drop.


##Why this name?
Because the companion app can prove to be quite informative for new players (or experienced players who took a break from the game), it is perfect for an "FNG" (Fresh New Graduate). Also, since Apex is set in a region called "The Outlands" and the companion app explores each aspect of the game, the app has been given the name "FNG Outlands Explorer".
